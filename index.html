            My name is Nguyen Thanh Tai, and I came into this world on the auspicious day of January 1st, 2005, in the picturesque province of Dong Nai, Vietnam. Within the bustling embrace of my family home, I found myself amidst a lively brood of six siblings, surrounded by the love and guidance of both my parents and my dear grandmother.

In every match, I discover not only the thrill of competition but also the invaluable lessons of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.
